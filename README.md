# ThessParking README

## Overview

**ThessParking** is a revolutionary mobile app designed to solve the parking problem in Central Macedonia, particularly in urban areas like Thessaloniki. With traffic congestion and limited parking spaces being a major headache for locals and visitors alike, ThessParking leverages user-generated content to create a dynamic, real-time parking solution. Whether you're looking for a parking spot or want to help others find one, ThessParking is here to make your parking experience easier, faster, and more rewarding.

## Key Features

- **Submit Parking Spots**: If you come across an available parking spot, you can easily submit it on the app to share it with others.
- **Claim Parking Spots**: When you're looking for a spot, simply browse the available listings and claim the one that suits you.
- **Report Invalid Parking Spots**: If a claimed parking spot is no longer available or is not valid, users can report it to keep the information up-to-date and accurate.
- **Earn Rewards**: Users who actively contribute to the app by submitting valid parking spots, claiming spots, and reporting invalid ones will earn a portion of the app's ad revenue, rewarding them for their time and effort.

## How It Works

1. **Submit**: If you find an empty parking spot, open ThessParking and submit the spot with its location and any additional details (like time limits, payment methods, etc.).
2. **Claim**: When searching for a parking spot, you can claim a spot that fits your needs. The app will guide you to the location of the spot.
3. **Report**: If a spot is no longer available, you can quickly report it, helping others avoid wasting time.
4. **Earn**: As a contributor, you’ll receive a portion of the app’s ad revenue based on your level of participation. The more you contribute, the more you earn!
